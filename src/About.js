<h3>OUR CUSTOMER</h3>
<p>Our customers are creative people, who want to be and look like themselves. They have a sense of adventure about what they wear, and take a thoughtful, personal approach to interior décor and the harmony of home. Although personal style is important to them, they’re not governed by trends. We listen to our customers and look to our community for inspiration and feedback – the intention is to exceed their every expectation, in unexpected ways.</p>
